I am looking at making a set of tools to help my families homeschool coop function more coherently, they have a meeting every year where they try to decide on things like communication, how to get everyones phone numbers, who is in what class, where should we send photos for the year book, etc...
so there is ALOT of ways we can take this, and there are many sub-apps really built into this one overarching software. so this is a cool opportunity to work on something more enterprise level in complexity. and utilize skills that are required to make that work
high level I am seeing these features, although I am gathering info on more specifics/ideas and prioritization right now

- Directory of people inside the coop (pretty simple crud, but parents/children/birthdays/phone numbers etc)
- Class management, the ability to create classes and assign teachers/helpers/kids to those classes (crud mostly)
- chat. the ability to have chats with anyone in the coop, but also long term chats for classes or other special groups
- image upload/gallery. the ability to upload images and tag them with people or classes to make it easier for yearbook or slide show presentations to get pics from throughout the year
- notifications, the ability for administrators to send out notifications to the whole coop or specific classes/groups with important news.
- curriculum/file sharing. the ability to build a library of curriculum which includes text/links/files that can easily be shared to a class for a specific days activities (eg. a science project that can be reused with all the instructions/video links/list of materials uploaded.

I am sure more ideas will be coming
